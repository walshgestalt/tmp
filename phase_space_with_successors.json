    "leaf_title": "000.101The combined land areas of Africa, Europe, and Asia embrace within their\nperimeters the Mediterranean, Black, Caspian, Aral, China, Arabian, Red, Baltic, and\nNorth seas: altogether their area was historically thought of only as a flat Universe\nsandwiched between heaven above and hell below and seemingly stretching away to\ninfinity in all lateral directions. Yet the total land area of this flat world constitutes less\nthan 17 percent of the subsequently-discovered-to-be-spherical Planet Earth's surface. All\nthe great empires of written history before A.D. 1500 lay well within that \"known\" flat\nworld: it was and as yet remains the spontaneous theater of popular historical\nconceptioning.000.102How did this pervading historical concept become outdated?  What changed\nthe terrestrial conceptionings adopted by the leaders of the world's power structures?000.103When the archaeologists' artifact-proven history of mathematics opens 4,000\nyears ago in Babylon and Mesopotamia, it is already a very sophisticated science.\nMathematics may well have had its beginnings much earlier in India or Indochina, as it is\nan art and science that has traveled consistently westward. Over 3,000 years ago the\nGreeks made further magnificent contributions to geometry, algebra, and calculation. Then\nabout 2,000 years ago the Roman Empire all but obliterated mathematics. A little more\nthan 1,000 years ago Arabs and Hindus traveling through North Africa began to restore\nsome of the ancient mathematics to the westward-evolving culture. When al-Khwarizmi's\noriginal A.D. 800 treatise on algebra was republished in Latin in\n\n\nCarthage in 1200, it required a further 200 years for his elucidation of the function of\nzero-the cipher-to be diffused into the university systems of Europe .000.104The cipher made possible the positioning of numbers, which in turn\nfacilitated division and multiplication. Imagine trying to multiply or divide with Roman\nnumerals . . . impossible!  The Renaissance began with the new calculating facility\nintroduced by the cipher.  The cipher was not only an essential tool in the work of\nCopernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, but it also brought about Columbus' revised\nconcepts of terrestrial navigation. It went on to instrument the mechanical and leverage\ncalculation capabilities of Leonardo; and in the art of ship design the cipher gave birth to\nstructural and mechanical engineering, which made possible the intertensioning and\ncompressioning calculations of the ribbed structural strength of a sailing vessel as well as\nthat of its vast wind-energy-driven complex of compression and tension spars, sails, and\nrigging-replacing the trial-and-error guesswork that had previously been used in naval and\nland architecture. This capability in mathematical multiplication and division opened up a\nwhole new field of safely anticipated structural engineering and navigation.000.105This new anticipatory science made large engineering projects possible, but it\nbecame known to, and then was employed by, only the world's richest schemers,\nmonarchs, nations, and pirate enterprisers. No others could afford to buy great ships.\nWith more powerfully engineered ships, humans emerged westward through Gibraltar to\nexplore the Atlantic, to sail around Africa, to reach the Orient and the Pacific by water,\nand to circumnavigate the globe. Thus it became public knowledge that the old\nopen-edged, infinite world system had closed back on itself in all circumferential directions\nto become a finite system: a closed sphere. The monarchs and merchants realized that,\nwithin that closed system, whoever commanded the line of most efficient high seas supply\nwould become the masters of world wealth. Ships could carry cargoes that overland\ncaravans could not.000.106In 1600 the East India Company was founded as a private enterprise by\nQueen Elizabeth and a small group of her intimates. The limited legal liability of their\nenterprise was granted by royal decree, and its projects were thereafter militarily sustained\nand protected by Great Britain's Royal Navy and colonial troops. In England the East\nIndia Company College was established to train the officers of the enterprise for their\nworld-wide deployment; that college and its handsome campus are still in operation as of\n1979.  The British Empire became the first in history of which it could be said that the Sun\nnever set.000.107As professor of economics at the East India Company College in 1810\nThomas Malthus became the first economic authority ever to receive in toto the vital\nstatistics of a world-embracing spherical empire. At the very end of the 18th century\nMalthus published his documented thesis that humanity was multiplying its numbers at a\ngeometric (exponential) rate of gain while increasing life-support production at only an\narithmetic (linear) rate of gain. And since the Earth is a finite, closed-system sphere, it\napparently became scientifically manifest that there is a fundamental inadequacy of life\nsupport on our planet. Until then all opinions on such matters had been pure guesses.000.108A third of a century after Malthus, Darwin attributed biological evolution to\nsurvival of only the fittest species (and individuals within species). Though he denied there\nwas any economic significance in his theory of evolution, the economists insisted that\nsuperior physical fitness obviously governed economic survival as well. Karl Marx\naccepted the scientific viewpoints of both Malthus and Darwin when he declared in effect\nthat the working class is the fittest to .survive: they know how to use the tools and to\ncultivate the fields-the wealthy are parasites. This inaugurated the supranational concept of\ntwo world-wide political classes and two competing theories of political organization.000.109As a consequence of the discoveries of Malthus and Darwin all the great\npolitical ideologies have since adopted a prime philosophy that says: \"You may not like\nour political system, but we are convinced that we have the fairest, most logical, and\ningenious method of coping with the inherent inadequacy of terrestrial life support, but\nsince there are others who disagree diametrically about the best method of coping, it can\nbe determined only by force of arms which system is the fittest to survive.\" Thus survival\nof the physically fittest became the basis for national departments of defense with their\npriority of access to the most advanced science and technology. The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

    "leaf_title": "000.102How did this pervading historical concept become outdated?  What changed\nthe terrestrial conceptionings adopted by the leaders of the world's power structures?000.103When the archaeologists' artifact-proven history of mathematics opens 4,000\nyears ago in Babylon and Mesopotamia, it is already a very sophisticated science.\nMathematics may well have had its beginnings much earlier in India or Indochina, as it is\nan art and science that has traveled consistently westward. Over 3,000 years ago the\nGreeks made further magnificent contributions to geometry, algebra, and calculation. Then\nabout 2,000 years ago the Roman Empire all but obliterated mathematics. A little more\nthan 1,000 years ago Arabs and Hindus traveling through North Africa began to restore\nsome of the ancient mathematics to the westward-evolving culture. When al-Khwarizmi's\noriginal A.D. 800 treatise on algebra was republished in Latin in\n\n\nCarthage in 1200, it required a further 200 years for his elucidation of the function of\nzero-the cipher-to be diffused into the university systems of Europe .000.104The cipher made possible the positioning of numbers, which in turn\nfacilitated division and multiplication. Imagine trying to multiply or divide with Roman\nnumerals . . . impossible!  The Renaissance began with the new calculating facility\nintroduced by the cipher.  The cipher was not only an essential tool in the work of\nCopernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, but it also brought about Columbus' revised\nconcepts of terrestrial navigation. It went on to instrument the mechanical and leverage\ncalculation capabilities of Leonardo; and in the art of ship design the cipher gave birth to\nstructural and mechanical engineering, which made possible the intertensioning and\ncompressioning calculations of the ribbed structural strength of a sailing vessel as well as\nthat of its vast wind-energy-driven complex of compression and tension spars, sails, and\nrigging-replacing the trial-and-error guesswork that had previously been used in naval and\nland architecture. This capability in mathematical multiplication and division opened up a\nwhole new field of safely anticipated structural engineering and navigation.000.105This new anticipatory science made large engineering projects possible, but it\nbecame known to, and then was employed by, only the world's richest schemers,\nmonarchs, nations, and pirate enterprisers. No others could afford to buy great ships.\nWith more powerfully engineered ships, humans emerged westward through Gibraltar to\nexplore the Atlantic, to sail around Africa, to reach the Orient and the Pacific by water,\nand to circumnavigate the globe. Thus it became public knowledge that the old\nopen-edged, infinite world system had closed back on itself in all circumferential directions\nto become a finite system: a closed sphere. The monarchs and merchants realized that,\nwithin that closed system, whoever commanded the line of most efficient high seas supply\nwould become the masters of world wealth. Ships could carry cargoes that overland\ncaravans could not.000.106In 1600 the East India Company was founded as a private enterprise by\nQueen Elizabeth and a small group of her intimates. The limited legal liability of their\nenterprise was granted by royal decree, and its projects were thereafter militarily sustained\nand protected by Great Britain's Royal Navy and colonial troops. In England the East\nIndia Company College was established to train the officers of the enterprise for their\nworld-wide deployment; that college and its handsome campus are still in operation as of\n1979.  The British Empire became the first in history of which it could be said that the Sun\nnever set.000.107As professor of economics at the East India Company College in 1810\nThomas Malthus became the first economic authority ever to receive in toto the vital\nstatistics of a world-embracing spherical empire. At the very end of the 18th century\nMalthus published his documented thesis that humanity was multiplying its numbers at a\ngeometric (exponential) rate of gain while increasing life-support production at only an\narithmetic (linear) rate of gain. And since the Earth is a finite, closed-system sphere, it\napparently became scientifically manifest that there is a fundamental inadequacy of life\nsupport on our planet. Until then all opinions on such matters had been pure guesses.000.108A third of a century after Malthus, Darwin attributed biological evolution to\nsurvival of only the fittest species (and individuals within species). Though he denied there\nwas any economic significance in his theory of evolution, the economists insisted that\nsuperior physical fitness obviously governed economic survival as well. Karl Marx\naccepted the scientific viewpoints of both Malthus and Darwin when he declared in effect\nthat the working class is the fittest to .survive: they know how to use the tools and to\ncultivate the fields-the wealthy are parasites. This inaugurated the supranational concept of\ntwo world-wide political classes and two competing theories of political organization.000.109As a consequence of the discoveries of Malthus and Darwin all the great\npolitical ideologies have since adopted a prime philosophy that says: \"You may not like\nour political system, but we are convinced that we have the fairest, most logical, and\ningenious method of coping with the inherent inadequacy of terrestrial life support, but\nsince there are others who disagree diametrically about the best method of coping, it can\nbe determined only by force of arms which system is the fittest to survive.\" Thus survival\nof the physically fittest became the basis for national departments of defense with their\npriority of access to the most advanced science and technology. The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear.

Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance.

Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s.

While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

    "leaf_title": "000.104The cipher made possible the positioning of numbers, which in turn\nfacilitated division and multiplication. Imagine trying to multiply or divide with Roman\nnumerals . . . impossible!  The Renaissance began with the new calculating facility\nintroduced by the cipher.  The cipher was not only an essential tool in the work of\nCopernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, but it also brought about Columbus' revised\nconcepts of terrestrial navigation. It went on to instrument the mechanical and leverage\ncalculation capabilities of Leonardo; and in the art of ship design the cipher gave birth to\nstructural and mechanical engineering, which made possible the intertensioning and\ncompressioning calculations of the ribbed structural strength of a sailing vessel as well as\nthat of its vast wind-energy-driven complex of compression and tension spars, sails, and\nrigging-replacing the trial-and-error guesswork that had previously been used in naval and\nland architecture. This capability in mathematical multiplication and division opened up a\nwhole new field of safely anticipated structural engineering and navigation.000.105This new anticipatory science made large engineering projects possible, but it\nbecame known to, and then was employed by, only the world's richest schemers,\nmonarchs, nations, and pirate enterprisers. No others could afford to buy great ships.\nWith more powerfully engineered ships, humans emerged westward through Gibraltar to\nexplore the Atlantic, to sail around Africa, to reach the Orient and the Pacific by water,\nand to circumnavigate the globe. Thus it became public knowledge that the old\nopen-edged, infinite world system had closed back on itself in all circumferential directions\nto become a finite system: a closed sphere. The monarchs and merchants realized that,\nwithin that closed system, whoever commanded the line of most efficient high seas supply\nwould become the masters of world wealth. Ships could carry cargoes that overland\ncaravans could not.000.106In 1600 the East India Company was founded as a private enterprise by\nQueen Elizabeth and a small group of her intimates. The limited legal liability of their\nenterprise was granted by royal decree, and its projects were thereafter militarily sustained\nand protected by Great Britain's Royal Navy and colonial troops. In England the East\nIndia Company College was established to train the officers of the enterprise for their\nworld-wide deployment; that college and its handsome campus are still in operation as of\n1979.  The British Empire became the first in history of which it could be said that the Sun\nnever set.000.107As professor of economics at the East India Company College in 1810\nThomas Malthus became the first economic authority ever to receive in toto the vital\nstatistics of a world-embracing spherical empire. At the very end of the 18th century\nMalthus published his documented thesis that humanity was multiplying its numbers at a\ngeometric (exponential) rate of gain while increasing life-support production at only an\narithmetic (linear) rate of gain. And since the Earth is a finite, closed-system sphere, it\napparently became scientifically manifest that there is a fundamental inadequacy of life\nsupport on our planet. Until then all opinions on such matters had been pure guesses.000.108A third of a century after Malthus, Darwin attributed biological evolution to\nsurvival of only the fittest species (and individuals within species). Though he denied there\nwas any economic significance in his theory of evolution, the economists insisted that\nsuperior physical fitness obviously governed economic survival as well. Karl Marx\naccepted the scientific viewpoints of both Malthus and Darwin when he declared in effect\nthat the working class is the fittest to .survive: they know how to use the tools and to\ncultivate the fields-the wealthy are parasites. This inaugurated the supranational concept of\ntwo world-wide political classes and two competing theories of political organization.000.109As a consequence of the discoveries of Malthus and Darwin all the great\npolitical ideologies have since adopted a prime philosophy that says: \"You may not like\nour political system, but we are convinced that we have the fairest, most logical, and\ningenious method of coping with the inherent inadequacy of terrestrial life support, but\nsince there are others who disagree diametrically about the best method of coping, it can\nbe determined only by force of arms which system is the fittest to survive.\" Thus survival\nof the physically fittest became the basis for national departments of defense with their\npriority of access to the most advanced science and technology. The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness.

That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately.

    "leaf_title": "000.106In 1600 the East India Company was founded as a private enterprise by\nQueen Elizabeth and a small group of her intimates. The limited legal liability of their\nenterprise was granted by royal decree, and its projects were thereafter militarily sustained\nand protected by Great Britain's Royal Navy and colonial troops. In England the East\nIndia Company College was established to train the officers of the enterprise for their\nworld-wide deployment; that college and its handsome campus are still in operation as of\n1979.  The British Empire became the first in history of which it could be said that the Sun\nnever set.000.107As professor of economics at the East India Company College in 1810\nThomas Malthus became the first economic authority ever to receive in toto the vital\nstatistics of a world-embracing spherical empire. At the very end of the 18th century\nMalthus published his documented thesis that humanity was multiplying its numbers at a\ngeometric (exponential) rate of gain while increasing life-support production at only an\narithmetic (linear) rate of gain. And since the Earth is a finite, closed-system sphere, it\napparently became scientifically manifest that there is a fundamental inadequacy of life\nsupport on our planet. Until then all opinions on such matters had been pure guesses.000.108A third of a century after Malthus, Darwin attributed biological evolution to\nsurvival of only the fittest species (and individuals within species). Though he denied there\nwas any economic significance in his theory of evolution, the economists insisted that\nsuperior physical fitness obviously governed economic survival as well. Karl Marx\naccepted the scientific viewpoints of both Malthus and Darwin when he declared in effect\nthat the working class is the fittest to .survive: they know how to use the tools and to\ncultivate the fields-the wealthy are parasites. This inaugurated the supranational concept of\ntwo world-wide political classes and two competing theories of political organization.000.109As a consequence of the discoveries of Malthus and Darwin all the great\npolitical ideologies have since adopted a prime philosophy that says: \"You may not like\nour political system, but we are convinced that we have the fairest, most logical, and\ningenious method of coping with the inherent inadequacy of terrestrial life support, but\nsince there are others who disagree diametrically about the best method of coping, it can\nbe determined only by force of arms which system is the fittest to survive.\" Thus survival\nof the physically fittest became the basis for national departments of defense with their\npriority of access to the most advanced science and technology. The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance.

This inaugurated the supranational concept of\ntwo world-wide political classes and two competing theories of political organization.000.109As a consequence of the discoveries of Malthus and Darwin all the great\npolitical ideologies have since adopted a prime philosophy that says: \"You may not like\nour political system, but we are convinced that we have the fairest, most logical, and\ningenious method of coping with the inherent inadequacy of terrestrial life support, but\nsince there are others who disagree diametrically about the best method of coping, it can\nbe determined only by force of arms which system is the fittest to survive.\" Thus survival\nof the physically fittest became the basis for national departments of defense with their\npriority of access to the most advanced science and technology. The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

The military took\ncommand of all the highest performance materials, brains, instruments, and tools of\nproduction.000.110Mutually assumed survival-only-of-the-fittest is the reason why the United\nStates and the USSR have for the past 30 years appropriated 200 billion dollars annually\nto buy ever more effective weapons of potential destruction. The great political and\nindustrial power structures have all become supranational comprehensivists, while the\npeople have been passport-chained to their respective 150 national preserves-the people\nhave become educationally divided into \"specialists\" for exploitation by the supranational\npowers who divide to conquer and divide to keep conquered.000.111Up until the 20th century reality consisted of everything that humans could\nsee, smell, touch, and hear. Then at the entry into the 20th century the electron was\ndiscovered. A century after the time of Malthus much of science became invisible with the\nintroduction of an era of electronics, electromagnetics, and atomics. These invisible micro-\nand macro-exploring cosmic instruments provided for rearrangements of atomic\ninterpositioning whose metallic alloying and chemical structuring produces ever more\npowerful and incisive performances per pound of physical matter employed.000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce. As of the 1970s muscle, guns, and intellectual cunning are\nruling world affairs and keeping them competitive by continuing the false premise of\nuniversal inadequacy of life support. If mind comes into supreme power within a decade,\nhumanity will exercise its option of a design revolution and will enter a new and-lasting\nepoch of physical success for all. If not, it will be curtains for all humanity within this\ncentury.000.131In complement with Synergetics 1 and 2 the posters atcolor plates 1-10may\nclarify for everyone the few scientific conceptions and mathematical tools necessary for\nuniversal comprehension and individual use of nature's synergetic geometrical\nintertransformings.Footnote:Rudyard Kipling labored under the only-you-or-me philosophy, but he was inspired by thoughts that it\nmight some day be otherwise:And no one will work for money and no one willwork for fameBut each for the joy of working, and each in hisseparate star,Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God ofThings as They are!\"- fromWhen Earth's Last Picture Is PaintedNext PageCopyright \u00a9 1997 Estate of Buckminster Fuller"

    "leaf_title": "000.112Structures are complexes of visible or invisible physical events interacting to\nproduce stable patterns. A structural system divides Universe into all Universe outside the\nstructural system (macrocosm) and all Universe inside the structural system (microcosm).\nNewton's discovery of mass interattraction showed that the interattraction force of atoms,\nplanets, stars, or galaxies increases exponentially as the interdistances decrease\narithmetically, and vice versa: halve the interdistance and make fourfold the interattractive\nintegrity of the remotely bodied structural system. That is the law of gravity. Symmetrical,\nnoncontacting, concentric interpositioning of already-symmetrical arrays of atoms\nproduces exponentially increased interatomic coherence of \"materials.\"000.113Gravity is the inwardly cohering force acting integratively on all systems.\nRadiation is the outwardly disintegrating force acting divisively upon all systems.000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance.

    "leaf_title": "000.114All structural systems are comprised of tension and compression\ncomponents. Stone masonry has a high compression-resisting strength of 50,000 pounds\nper square inch ultimate. But masonry has low tensional coherence; it can withstand only\n50 pounds per square inch tensing. Stone-Age-derived masonry is a thousand times more\neffective in its resistance to compression than to tension.000.115Throughout the three million known years of the Stone Age humans relied\non gravity to hold their vertical stone walls together until (as often happened) they were\nshaken apart by earthquakes against which they had almost no tensionally cohering\nresistance. Gravity pushed humanity's stone structures inward toward the Earth's center.\nHumans had to build their structures on bedrock \"shoes\" to prevent them from sinking\nvertically into Earth's center. Stone buildings could not float on water. But nature had\ninvented low-weight wood of high self-cohering tensile strength (averaging approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.) and of relatively low compression-resistive capability (also approximately\n10,000 p.s.i.). Wood floated on water and could move useful loads horizontally; wood\nmade good rafts for transporting humans but not for floating heavy cargoes. Thus the high\ntensile strength of wood, combined with the human discovery of the intertrussing\nprinciples of structuring and the low overall displacement weights involved, made possible\nfor humans to design and fabricate air-enclosing wooden vessels whose structure and\nspace enclosure combined to produce highly successful wooden vessels of the sea that\ncould carry great cargoes.000.116In the 1850s humans arrived at the mass production of steel, an alloy of iron,\ncarbon, and manganese having a tensile strength of 50,000 p.s.i. as well as a\ncompression-resisting capability of 50.000 p.s.i. Steel has the same compression-resistance\ncapability as masonry, but it also has a thousand times greater tensile capability than\nmasonry and five times the tensile or compressive strength of wood. Steel brought\nmankind a structural-tension capability to match stone's previous millions of years of\nexclusive compressional supremacy. With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience.

With far higher tensile strength per weight than\nwood, steel made possible even more powerful watertight, air-containing vessels than did\nwood, even though steel by itself does not float.000.117The technology of metallurgy began developing metal alloys of ever higher\nstrength-to-weight ratios. Out of this came aluminum production by the opening of the\n20th century-and aluminum alloys and stainless steel by the 1930s. These new materials\nmade it possible to design and build engine-powered all-metal airplanes (structural\nvessels), which could pull themselves angularly above the horizontal and ever more steeply\naloft. With the advent of successively higher strength-to-weight ratios of metal alloys and\nglass-reinforced plastic materials, ever more heavily laden airplanes were designed, which\ncould climb ever more steeply and faster. Finally humans developed so much strength per\nweight of materials capability that they accomplished \"vertol\" jet plane flight and vertical\nspace-vehicle blastoffs. Since then human scientists developing ever greater strength per\nweight of material have gone on to carry ever greater useful loads in vertical takeoff\nvehicles at ever more accelerated rates of ascent.000.118As of the 1970s the human mind has developed a practical tensile structuring\ncapability of 600,000 p.s.i. The means of accomplishing this new and overwhelming\nstructural strength has become entirely invisible. Fully 99 percent of humanity has as yet\nno idea that this increase in tensile capability has come about or how it came about or why\nit works. While humans cannot see the ever-lessening interatomic proximity of atoms and\nelectrons of electromagnetic events, they can witness the ever more vertical takeoff-angle\ncapabilities manifesting human comprehension of the fundamental structuring principles\nand their military developments and profitable commercial uses. But only vast money\ninvestments or vast governments can afford to exploit the increased technical advantages.000.119Before the airplane humans said, \"You cannot lift yourself by your\nbootstraps.\" Today we are lifting ever lighter and stronger structural vessel \"selves\" by\never less effort of our scientific know-how bootstraps. No economist knows this. It is the\nmost highly classified of military and private enterprise secrets. Industry now converts the\never-increasing work capacity per pound of materials invested primarily to yield monetary\nprofits for the government-subsidized private-enterprise producers of weapons.000.120Now in the 1970s we can state an indisputable proposition of abundance of\nwhich the world power structures do not yet have dawning awareness. We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone. Fortunately television, is spontaneously\nattractive and can be used to teach all the world's people nature's coordinating system-and\ncan do so in time to make it possible for all humanity to favorably comprehend and to\nexercise its option to attain universal physical success, thereby eliminating forevermore all\nworld politics and competition for the right to live. The hydrogen atom does not have to\ncompromise its function potential by first \"earning a living\" before it can function directly\nas a hydrogen atom.000.129Nature's coordinate system is called Synergetics-synergy means behavior of\nwhole systems unpredicted by any part of the system as considered only separately. The\neternally regenerative Universe is synergetic. Humans have been included in this cosmic\ndesign as local Universe information-gatherers and local problem-solvers in support of the\nintegrity of the eternal, 100-percent-efficient, self-regenerative system of Universe. In\nsupport of their cosmic functioning humans were given their minds with which to discover\nand employ the generalized laws governing all physical and metaphysical,\nomniinteraccommodative, ceaseless intertransformings of Universe.000.130At present 99 percent of humanity is misinformed in believing in the\nMalthusian concept of the fundamental inadequacy of life support, and so they have\nmisused their minds to develop only personal and partisan advantages, intellectual\ncunning, and selfishness. Intellectual cunning has concentrated on how to divorce money\nfrom true life-support wealth; second, cunning has learned how to make money with\nmoney by making it scarce.

We can state that\nas a consequence of the myriad of more-with-less, invisible, technological advances of the\n20th century, and employing only well-proven technologies and already mined and ever\nmore copiously recirculating materials, it is now technically feasible to retool and redirect\nworld industry in such a manner that within 10 years we can have all of humanity enjoying\na sustainably higher standard of living-with vastly increased\ndegrees of freedom than has ever been enjoyed by anyone in all history.000.121During this 10-year period we can also phase out all further use of fossil\nfuels and atomic energy, since the retooled world industry and individual energy needs will\nhave become completely supplied by our combined harvests of electromagnetic,\nphotosynthetic, chemical, and biological products of the daily energy income initially\nproduced by Sun and gravity. Industry, retooled from weapons production to livingry\nproduction, will rehouse the deployed phases of world-humans by single-family,\nair-deliverable, energy harvesting, only-rentable dwelling machines. When humans are\nconvergent, they will dwell in domed-over moon-crater cities that will be\nenergy-harvesting and -exporting centers rather than energy sinkholes.000.122All of the foregoing makes it possible to say that since we now know that\nthere is a sustainable abundance of life support and accommodation for all, it follows that\nall politics and warring are obsolete and invalid. We no longer need to rationalize\nselfishness. No one need ever again \"earn a living.\" Further living for all humanity is all\ncosmically prepaid.000.123Why don't we exercise our epochal option? Governments are financed\nthrough taxation and would have no way of putting meters between the people and their\ndirectly received individual cosmic incomes. So too, private enterprise should no more\nmeter the energy than it meters the air. But all of Earthians' present power\nstructures-political, religious, or capitalist-would find their interests disastrously\nthreatened by total human success. They are founded upon assumption of scarcity; they\nare organized for and sustained by the problems imposed by the assumption of\nfundamental inadequacies of life support.000.124Why does not the public itself demand realization of its option for a\nrevolution by design science? Less than one percent of humanity now knows that the\noption exists; 99 percent of humanity cannot understand the mathematical language of\nscience. The people who make up that 99 percent do not know that all that science has\never found out is that the Universe consists of the most reliable technology. They think of\ntechnology as something new; they regard it as threatening both in terms of modern\nweaponry and as job-eliminating competition for their life-sustaining opportunities to\n\"earn a living.\"  Ergo, humanity thinks it is against technology and thinks itself averse to\nexercising its option.000.125The fact that 99 percent of humanity does not understand nature is the prime\nreason for humanity's failure to exercise its option to attain universally sustainable physical\nsuccess on this planet. The prime barrier to humanity's discovery and comprehension of\nnature is the obscurity of the mathematical language of science. Fortunately, however,\nnature is not using the strictly imaginary, awkward, and unrealistic coordinate system\nadopted by and taught by present-day academic science.000.126Nature's continuous self-regeneration is 100 percent efficient, neither\ngaining nor losing any energy. Nature is not employing the three dimensional,\nomniinterperpendicular, parallel frame of the XYZ axial coordinates of academic science,\nnor is nature employing science's subsequently adopted gram/centimeter/second\nweight/area/time exponents. Nature does not operate in parallel. She operates in\nradiational divergence and gravitational convergence. She grows outwardly by\nomniintertriangulated structuring from nuclei.000.127Nature is inherently eight-dimensional, and the first four of these dimensions\nare the four planes of symmetry of the minimum structure of Universe-the\nomnitriangulated, equi-vector-edge tetrahedron. In respect to the conceptual pre-time-size\ntetrahedron's volume taken as unity 1, with its six unit-vector-edge structure, the always\nconceptual-independent-of-size family of primitive, pre-time-size, least complex polyhedra\nhave the following exact volumes-the vector-triangulated cube 3, the octahedron 4, the\nrhombic triacontahedron 5, and the rhombic dodecahedron 6. When the size information is\nintroduced, it occurs only as frequency of modular subdivision of each unit vector\nstructuring of the primitive family's respective 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-tetravolumes.\nFrequency to the third power, F3, values then multiply the primitive,\nalready-four-dimensional volumetric values. In physically realized time-size each has\ntherefore 4 + 3 = 7 dimensions, but since each system is inherently independent in\nUniverse and therefore has spinnability, one more dimensional factor is required, making a\ntotal of eight dimensions in all for experientially evidencing physical reality.000.1271To define the everywhere-and-everywhen-transforming cosmic environment\nof each and every system requires several more intercovarying system\ndimensions-planetary, solar, galactic, intergalactic. Because of the six positive and six\nnegative degrees of freedom governing systems-within-systems intertransforming, we have\n8 + 6 = 14 dimensional systems in cosmic relationship governance.000.128Nature is using this completely conceptual eight-dimensional coordinate\nsystem that can be comprehended by anyone.
